This demo uses spring-boot and spring mail to send emails.

To run this application, please visit src/main/resources/application.properties and change spring.mail.username, spring.mail.password to your credentials. 

Note : Gmail will not allow using its smtp from less secured apps. You might need to switch off that feature while testing to send email. 
In gmail, my account goto Sign-in & Security --> Connected apps & sites --> Allow less secure apps: turn it on.
